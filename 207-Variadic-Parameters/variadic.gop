//joinstr function that is called with the varying number of arguments is known as variadic function.
//In the declaration of the joinstr function, the type of the last parameter is preceded by an ellipsis, i.e, (â€¦).
//It indicates that the function can be called at any number of parameters of string.
//The call joinstr(elements...), if without that ..., it wouldn't compile because the types would be wrong; elements is not of type string.
