// Golang provides encapsulation at the package level. Go doesnâ€™t have any public,  private or protected keyword. The only mechanism to control the visibility is using the capitalized and non-capitalized formats

// Capitalized Identifiers are exported. The capital letter indicates that this is an exported identifier.
// Non-capitalized identifiers are not exported. The lowercase indicates that the identifier is not exported and will only be accessed from within the same package.

// There are five kinds of identifier which can be exported or non-exported.
