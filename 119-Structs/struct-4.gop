//
// A field in a struct is accessed with dotted notation:

type person struct {
	name string
	age  int
	pet  string
}

bob := person{
	age:  30,
	name: "Beth",
}
bob.name = "Bob"
println(beth.name)

// Just like we use brackets for both reading and writing to a map, we use dotted
// notation for reading and writing struct fields.
