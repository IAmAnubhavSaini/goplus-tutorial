// Anonymous structs add a small twist to this: if two struct variables are being
// compared and at least one of them has a type thatâ€™s an anonymous struct, you
// can compare them without a type conversion if the fields of both structs have the
// same names, order, and types. You can also assign between named and
// anonymous struct types if the fields of both structs have the same names, order,
// and types.
