// Second, if instead the asserted type T is an interface type, then the type assertion checks
// whether xâ€™s dynamic type satisfies T. If this check succeeds, the dynamic value is not extracted;
// the result is still an interface value with the same type and value components, but the result
// has the interface type T. In other words, a type assertion to an interface type changes the type
// of the expression, making a different (and usually larger) set of methods accessible, but it
// preserves the dynamic type and value components inside the interface value.
